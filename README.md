# Bootcamp-Personal-Portfolio
This is my portfolio from the boot camp class

## Description
This portfolio challenge helped me create a website from scratch. Challenging all my learning of HTML structure, hirearchy, and attributes. As well as an indepth look at CSS such as: flexbox, bracround images, pading, positioning, color, fonts, stlyes. almost everything was a challenge and frustration but getting through those challeges was extremly satisfying.
